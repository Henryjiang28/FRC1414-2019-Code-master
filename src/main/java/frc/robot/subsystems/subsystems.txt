- Drivetrain (setup pids, inversion, and sensor phase)
- Elevator (setup pids, check inversions, sensor phase, and setup velocity, acceleration and setpoints)
- Arm (setup pids, check inversions, sensor phase, and setup velocity, acceleration and setpoints)
- Intake (set default command when finished testing for continous run, and piston directions)
- Climb (set ramp rate and piston directions)
